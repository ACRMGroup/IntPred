* DONE Make XMAS Parsing more robust
  CLOSED: [2015-07-27 Mon 11:58]
At the moment parseXMAS.pm parses lines by assuming the order of attributes,
which may change. Implement XMAS header parsing to determine the order of XMAS
attributes properly.

This is no longer a problem, as XMAS dependencies have been removed from
tcnutils/pdb

* DONE Add Anja's option for scorecons
  CLOSED: [2015-05-19 Tue 17:11]
This is in her Perl_paths.pm file $valdar01_params = "--matrixnorm karlinlike";
This is how scorecons is run:
    my $cmd = "$Perl_paths::scoreconsExe $msa_fname $Perl_paths::valdar01_params";

* DONE Run blast with Anja's options and an evalue filter
  CLOSED: [2015-05-21 Thu 20:46]

* TODO Implement assignment of pdb chain to swissprot entry automatically
This would allow the determination of FOSTA FEPs for non-deposited (i.e. user
specified) chains.

* DONE instance->string ordering
  CLOSED: [2015-05-21 Thu 20:46]
user should be able to: pass array of features in desired order,
use the order of features within a feature string, or use a default.

Or, implement processor::master->printInstances(). TOMORROW, test printInstances

* DONE Setting missing values
  CLOSED: [2015-05-23 Sat 18:13]
In theory, only blast and fosta should possibly be missing.
Eval can be used and exceptions can be thrown. Types can be used to allow
'?' for Num features.
** DONE Test for missing FOSTA
   CLOSED: [2015-05-21 Thu 22:21]
** DONE Test for missing BLAST
   CLOSED: [2015-05-23 Sat 18:13]

* DONE test autoLabel when interfaceResidues are not specified in test
  CLOSED: [2015-05-26 Tue 11:29]
This is to ensure that interfaceResidues builder wor ok

* DONE Separate new scripts into new directory
  CLOSED: [2015-05-27 Wed 13:53]

* TODO Improve BLAST/FOSTA Error Handling
Script needs to die if it's anything other than a < minimum hits problem.

* TODO Improve wekaOutputParser
At the moment this assumes the form of the output CSV. This could lead to 
problems in the future
* TODO Deal with arff self-standardization
* TODO Standardize test sets without having to reload training set
This could be possible if I write a short java program that took a training
set, created a Standardization Filter and initalized it with the training set,
then serialize that filter object.
